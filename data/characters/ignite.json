Since birth, she was assigned to be the personal guard of the youngest daughter of the Everlight's Paragon---Ciarra Crownsworth. They grew up together and became best friends. Eris later on joined Ciarra and the others to create the Seven Order of Everlight, where she continued to shine through her talent and became one of the strongest flame masters in the world."
