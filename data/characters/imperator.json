Where one goes, the other follows—an inseparable force that has never lost a flank in the war against the Hellspawns. Everett wields a unique soulforge known as the Golden Sentry, a floating apparatus that hovers over the battlefield. From this vantage point, he rains down needles of pure light energy that will always bring victory to the Seventh Order.",
