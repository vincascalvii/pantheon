Thanks to the Paragon's ancestry, she naturally possesses the symbol of her race & Bastion, the ability to bend light to her will.

Aside from light, she can also control every other natural element in the world, granting her the title of the Elemental Master. In the battlefield, she has also earned the nickname of the Silver-Haired Witch, but in contrast to the ominous name, she is one of the Four Great Beauties in Valhalla.",
