Through a series of world-altering events, Cyrus was chosen as the vessel for the Ascension. He shed his mortality to become a Sovereign, joining the ranks of the celestial rulers of the mortal realms. Now possessed of Absolute Authority, Cyrus has transitioned from a protector to a judge. He no longer sees individuals, only \"worthiness\". To him, the world is a chaotic system that requires the \"Definite Judgment\" of a god to remain stable.",
